# jdbc-pg-init

This is a Clojure library to create PostgreSQL tables, keys, and indices from
edn data.

Really, there should be a general DDL solution in Clojure. But we
needed something immediately, so this is what we made.

Contact us if you're interested in contributing to a more general solution.

## Usage

Add the following to your [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) dependencies:
```
[jdbc-pg-init "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT2"]
```
